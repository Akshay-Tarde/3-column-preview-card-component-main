## My process
I approached this challenge as a mobile first design. I used flexbox to make it responsive.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Mobile layout and Desktop layout styling should be done in such a way that there is minimal repetition of CSS code. This principle leads to consistency in the design output and has less chance of weird CSS behaviour.

### Continued development

I had problems with making the buttons responsive at all screen sizes. The buttons breaks the flow of the different sections because the paragraphs above them have different amounts of text.
I would like to improve this aspect of the project.
